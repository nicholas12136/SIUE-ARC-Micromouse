# CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:
#
# 1. CENTER PERIMETER FIX: After Prim's runs, forcing all center perimeter
#    walls back to True can seal off cells that were only reachable through
#    those walls, breaking the maze's connectivity. Fix: we now run a
#    connectivity check after enforcing center rules and retry generation
#    from scratch if the maze is broken.
#
# 2. CONNECTIVITY VALIDATION: A flood fill from (0,0) confirms that every
#    single cell in the finished maze is reachable before saving. If any
#    cell is unreachable, the maze is thrown out and regenerated. This is
#    the safety net that catches any issue — not just the center perimeter
#    problem — that could produce an unsolvable maze.
#
# 3. START CORNER KEPT AT (0,0): The start is always bottom-left for full
#    compatibility with the mms simulator. Testing different physical start
#    corners is handled in Main.cpp via the heading detection logic, not
#    by changing the maze file. The random North/East wall choice from the
#    previous version is preserved so the start cell still has exactly 3
#    walls with one random open passage, which exercises the heading
#    detection code properly.
