## 📌 Project Overview
Our team is developing an autonomous "Mouse" to compete in the **National Robotics Challenge**. The robot must navigate a $10 \times 10$ unit square maze, mapping the environment in real-time to find the fastest path to the center.

### 📐 Competition Constraints (NRC Rules)
**Some Basics:**
* **Mouse Size:** Max $7" \times 7" \times 7"$.
* **Maze Size:** $10 \times 10$ of $10" \times 10"$ tiles.
* **Time:** 10-minute total run time.
* **Autonomy:** No external communication once the maze layout is disclosed.
* **Scoring:** Based on a factor of things but overall shortest time wins.

**Maze Criteria:**
* No inaccessible locations
* Mouse will always start in one of the four corners 
* Exactly three starting walls
* Only one entrance to the center, , multiple paths to the destination square are allowed and are to be expected
* Has a hollow center, i.e., the center peg has no walls attached to it
* Has walls attached to every peg except the center peg
* Is unsolvable by a wall-following robot 

**Time Criteria:**
* The run timer will start when the front edge of the robot crosses the start line and stops when
the front edge of the robot crosses the finish line
* If a robot re-enters the start square before entering the destination square on a run that run is aborted and a new run will begin with a new time that starts when the starting square is exited.
* The robot may, after reaching the destination square, continue to navigate the maze for as long
as their total maze time allows. The time taken will not count toward any run.
* If an operator touches the robot during a run, it is
deemed aborted, and the robot must be removed from the maze.
* If a robot has already crossed the finish line, it may be removed at any time without affecting the
run time of that run
* The minimum run time shall be the robot's official time (Dash Attempt).

**Scoring Criteria:**
* Robots that do not enter the center square will be ranked by the maximum number of cells they
consecutively transverse without being touched. However, judges are not required to give any
rankings to robots who do not finish and may declare no winners or declare less than three
winners at their discretion.

**Alteration Criteria:**
* After the maze is disclosed, the operator shall not feed information on the maze into the robot.
However, switch positions may be changed for the purpose of changing programs within the
robot (changing algorithms is allowed)
* A contestant may not alter a robot in a manner that alters its weight
* contestants are allowed to: Change switch settings (e.g., to change algorithms), replace batteries between runs, adjust sensors, change speed settings, make repairs 

</ul>

## 🧠 Navigation Progress
We are currently iterating on two main logic paths:

-  **Flood Fill:** - A form of Breadth-First Searching, it works by "pouring water" from the goal to the start, assigning distance values to cells. The mouse then moves toward lower-value cells, effectively calculating the shortest path. ([**Video explanation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktn3C7aXVR0))
-  **Depth-First Search:** - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is "blind" to the shortest path until it has explored all options. Great for mapping an entire maze because it forces the mouse to explore every nook and cranny, but it is high unlikely to find the shortest path on the first try.
