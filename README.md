## 📌 Project Overview
Our team is developing an autonomous "Mouse" to compete in the **National Robotics Challenge**. The robot must navigate a $10 \times 10$ unit square maze, mapping the environment in real-time to find the fastest path to the center.

### 📐 Competition Constraints (NRC Rules)
**Some Basics:**
* **Mouse Size:** Max $7" \times 7" \times 7"$.
* **Maze Size:** $10 \times 10$ of $10" \times 10"$ tiles.
* **Time:** 10-minute total run time.
* **Autonomy:** No external communication once the maze layout is disclosed.
* **Scoring:** Based on the fastest run + search time penalties.
* **Wall Hugging:** It is explicitly mentioned in the rules that steps will be taken to diminish this searching algorithm. 
* **Starting Place:** Mouse will always start in one of the four corners, the start square will be bounded on three sides by walls.
* **Finish Line:** Goal is to end up in the four-tile room in the middle, the destination square has only one entrance. However, multiple paths to the destination square are allowed and are to be expected.
* **Winner Winner Chicken Dinner:** The minimum run time shall be the robot's official time (Dash Attempt).

## 🧠 Navigation Progress
We are currently iterating on two main logic paths:

-  **Flood Fill:** - Works by "pouring water" from the goal to the start, assigning distance values to cells. The mouse then moves toward lower-value cells, effectively calculating the shortest path. ([**Video explanation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktn3C7aXVR0))
-  **Depth Search:** - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is "blind" to the shortest path until it has explored all options.
