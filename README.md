## 📌 Project Overview
Our team is developing an autonomous "Mouse" to compete in the **National Robotics Challenge**. The robot must navigate a $10 \times 10$ unit square maze, mapping the environment in real-time to find the fastest path to the center.

### ⚖️ Competition Constraints (NRC Rules)
* **Size:** Max $7" \times 7" \times 7"$.
* **Time:** 10-minute total run time.
* **Autonomy:** No external communication once the maze layout is disclosed.
* **Scoring:** Based on the fastest run + search time penalties.

## 🧠 Navigation Progress
We are currently iterating on two main logic paths:

-  **Flood Fill:** - Works by "pouring water" from the goal to the start, assigning distance values to cells. The mouse then moves toward lower-value cells, effectively calculating the shortest path.
-  **Depth Search:** - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is "blind" to the shortest path until it has explored all options.
